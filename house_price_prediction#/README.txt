This is data predictive analysis for houses price.
The dataset is a training set that I got from Kaggle, it consist lots 
of data columns all about houses attributes at a certain community. We 
based our price predictions on the house features such as the central air, 
lot area, quality, condition, numbers of floors, numbers of bedrooms & age.
