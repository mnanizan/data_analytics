This is analysis for teenagers alcohol drinking data from two schools in 
Portugal.
We find the confidence intervals for the mean of the final grade by using 
the Cetral Limit Theorem & calculate probability calculations by using the binomial & probability 
mass function.
Lastly we set up few hypothesis and did some analysis to proves it.
The hypothesis are:
1) Are the population variances equal in the groups of students (Low vs High 
alcohol consumption)?
2) Does alcohol consumption affect academic performance?
3) Do male teenagers drink more than female teenagers?
